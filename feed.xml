     <summary>Effectively speaking, I've always been a Vim user. When I got my first shell account, I started with Vim (In the Paleozoic, Mesozoic and Cenozoic ages of `vi`, `vim` and `neovim`, I came of age somewhere in the late Jurassic): my first CS teacher had studied at MIT and so was a dyed-in-the-wool LISP hacker; accordingly, he set up a Linux server in the back of the server closet at my high school, gave me a shell account, and introduced me to `emacs`. By that point I already found myself inclined to the left-hand side of the dichotomy between what felt like the lightness and agility of Vim (shorter startup times, fewer keypresses) and the power and flexibility of Emacs....</summary>

     <summary>I've been spending a lot of time with the [Nim][] programming language recently. It's a great language: its principles, roughly, are to achieve the efficiency and speed of C with a much greater level of safety and expressiveness. It also so happens to take a lot of its surface-level syntactic cues from Python, including code structuring through significant whitespace and colons---that plus its emphasis on expressiveness make it very appealing and inviting to a Python programmer (like myself) who wants greater type safety and greater speed in their code....</summary>

     <summary>[Uncle Bob][], noted programming pundit, has written a strange [blog post](http://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2017/01/11/TheDarkPath.html). It's a litany against, as near as I can tell, a certain attitude around static typing: that the purpose of strong static typing, and by extension programming language features, is to provide a high degree of security against certain classes of programmer errors: uncaught exceptions, unchecked nulls, using Javascript, et cetera....</summary>

     <summary>In French Canada, according to [Pagat.com][1], there's a game called [*Mitaines*][2], which means "Mittens" in French. I'm not sure when I first heard about this game, but it stuck with me. I couldn't fathom, judging from the rules, how it was played, but I knew that the game consisted of building combinations that were called *mittens*, *gloves*, and *socks*. This struck me as adorable and odd. I couldn't find any other information about it; if you google "Mitaines card game", the only results aside from Pagat are pages that seem to derive entirely from Pagat, and earlier works by me, including the [stream][3] on [Thoughtstreams.io][4] that this article is based on. But Pagat is pretty authoritative so I persist in believing that this game exists....</summary>
