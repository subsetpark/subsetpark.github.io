The game in question is from Cagliari, and known variously as either Scialandroni or Scialandrone.</p> <p>Unlike with my account of <a href=../posts/mariglia>Mariglia</a>, there is not only very little written (in English or Italian) about this game, but I couldn't find anyone with personal knowledge of the game who was available to speak with me about it.</p> <p>Therefore this is based almost entirely on a single source, the <em>regole del gioco</em> available in this <a href=http://www.enricolobina.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Regolamento-Scialandrone.pdf>pamphlet</a>.</p> <p>I've done a bit of inference and guesswork, but there's much uncertainty left.</p> <hr> <h1>Overview</h1> <p>Here's what I can suss out: Scialandroni is a member of the <a href=https://www.pagat.com/stops/ ><em>Stops Group</em></a>, and more specifically a compendium game in the Poch subgroup. This can be seen by its basic structure, which consists in several phases: in the first phases, players draw cards and vie for the best combination of the cards they were dealt in that phase. In the last phase, they play out the entirety of their hands at Stops.</p> <p>There is, however, an important structural distinction in the Stops phase which I would love to understand better, and which I'll touch on in more detail later. There are also some additional syncretic points of interest and details which give this game a knotty, somewhat disreputable (in the best way!) flavor.</p> <p>Scialandroni (or Su Scialandroni, <em>Su</em> being the Sardinian definite article), is a game played for four, in fixed partnerships of two. It is generally played with the <em>genovesi</em> pack, which is a standard Italian 40-card deck.</p> <h1>Structure</h1> <p>A session of Scialandroni is played as the best of three games. Each game consists of five phases:</p> <ol> <li>1st Posta</li> <li>2nd Posta</li> <li>Cartetta</li> <li>Posta Grande</li> <li>Scartu</li> </ol> <p>Which differ among each other and will be covered individually, but generally comprise a series of 4 vying rounds followed by playing out all the cards received in those rounds at Stops.</p> <h1>Chips</h1> <p>Scialandroni plays out as a series of in-game payments among players for different feats, bets, and so on. There are a few denominations of currency; I'll use the Sardinian terminology, though I'll inflect them for the plural in English.</p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th>Unit</th> <th>Value</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>arriali</td> <td>1</td> </tr> <tr> <td>mesu soddu</td> <td>3</td> </tr> <tr> <td>soddu</td> <td>6</td> </tr> <tr> <td>francu</td> <td>60</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <h1>Card Values</h1> <p>For the vying phases of the game, the cards have particular values based on their rank.</p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th>Rank</th> <th>Value</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>Court Card</td> <td>10</td> </tr> <tr> <td>2</td> <td>12</td> </tr> <tr> <td>3</td> <td>13</td> </tr> <tr> <td>4</td> <td>14</td> </tr> <tr> <td>5</td> <td>15</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Ace</td> <td>16</td> </tr> <tr> <td>6</td> <td>18</td> </tr> <tr> <td>7</td> <td>21</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>Eagle-eyed readers will note that these are the same values as in the <em>Primiera</em>, as in Scopa, and the game of the same name.</p> <h1>Scorekeeping</h1> <p>NB: My understanding of this part is shaky. I will describe my reconstruction of how score is kept.</p> <p>Part of the distinctiveness of this game is the apparatus of scoring. To keep score authentically, two pieces of equipment are required:</p> <ul> <li>The <em>bintixincu</em>: two separate cards, face down, side-by-side on the table.</li> <li>A number of bottle caps; around 30 is usually sufficient to score an entire game.</li> </ul> <p>Each team is assigned one side of the <em>bintixincu</em>. Bottle caps are placed either <em>on</em> or <em>next to</em> it (on the side of the team they count for), and placed either <em>right side up</em> or <em>upside down</em>. Thus there are four possible states that a bottle cap might be in, which correspond to four possible point values (values in <em>arrialis</em>, the base unit, given in parentheses):</p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th></th> <th>Upside Down</th> <th>Right side up</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>On the table</td> <td>1 arriali (1)</td> <td>1 soddu (6)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>On the <em>bintixincu</em></td> <td>5 soddus (30)</td> <td>-1 arriali (-1)</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>Note that the negative value allows for abritrarily precise quantities to be notated.</p> <p>Where my understanding is lacking: the value of certain bids in this game is given as &quot;the whole pot&quot;. I do not believe there is any form of ante or betting by putting chips into the pot, because I don't think either team has a stack of chips.</p> <p>If that's so, the only candidate for the &quot;pot&quot; is the chips that are already on the <em>bintixincu</em>; ie, those which have been scored in prior phases. My best guess is that teams accumulate chips as the five phases progress, and the value of the pot at any point in the game is all the chips on and next to the <em>bintixincu</em>.</p> <h1>Phases</h1> <h2>Before The Game</h2> <p>Two cards are removed from the deck before play: a 2 and a 3. The specific suits don't matter, but they should be of different suits. These constitute the <em>bintixincu</em>, described above.</p> <p>The two teams cut for high card to determine dealer.</p> <h2>I. 1st Posta</h2> <p>The dealer deals four cards to each player.</p> <p>The winner of this phase is the one with the greatest point value, where the point value is the sum (according to the above table), of any three cards <em>of the same suit</em>. In case of a tie, the winner is the player closer to the dealer's right.</p> <p>Players take turns speaking, beginning to the dealer's right (the <em>mano</em>), and proceeding counter-clockwise.</p> <p>As in Poker, and other vying games, players can bluff as to the strength of their hands. Thus the actions available are: <em>bet</em>, <em>call</em>, <em>raise</em>, and <em>pass</em>. However, unlike Poker, these actions have fixed values associated with them[^fixed-values].</p> <p>[^fixed-values]: This is according to my understanding of scorekeeping, as established above. This is definitely where the greatest degree of uncertainty is in this description.</p> <pre><code>It should be noted that in the related game *Stoppa*, the rule
seems to be otherwise; a description in *The Playing Card*
indicates that there are small stakes to be won if a player bets
and nobody sees their bet, but implies that as soon as a bet is
seen, the players are vying for amounts that they bet (in addition
to the stake). 

On the other hand, the description of Scialandroni gives fixed
amounts for each outcome but one of the vying phase. This suggests
to me that players do not bet specific amounts, but that there are
fixed payouts for each scenario.
</code></pre> <p>When there is no bet, the active player has the opportunity to <em>pass</em> or to <em>bet</em>. If they bet, they open up vying for the best point sum out of three cards with the same suit.</p> <p>It's important to note that to <em>pass</em> is not to fold; a player who has passed can re-enter the bidding later.</p> <p>If a player has bet, then the two members of the opposing team can <em>call</em>, <em>raise</em>, or <em>pass</em>[^same-team-see]</p> <p>[^same-team-see]: It's not noted explicitly, but it seems to follow that if one member of a team opens bidding, their partner simply passes.</p> <h3>Both Opponents Pass</h3> <p>If one player bets and both opponents pass, then the player's team scores 2 arrialis.</p> <h3>One Opponent Calls</h3> <p>If one of the two opponents calls, then the two players show their cards[^show-their-cards]; the team of whoever has the higher sum wins 4 arrialis.</p> <p>[^show-their-cards]: The text is not more specific than &quot;show their cards&quot;; I read this as displaying their entire 4-card hands.</p> <h3>Both Opponents Call</h3> <p>If both members of the opposing team call, all three players show their cards, and there are two possible outcomes:</p> <h4>One of the Opponents Wins</h4> <p>The opponents win 4 arrialis.</p> <h4>The Betting Player Wins</h4> <p>The betting player wins 7 arrialis.</p> <h3>An Opponent Raises</h3> <p>Instead of <em>calling</em>, a confident opponent (including one who has passed already) may <em>raise</em>. Unlike with a call, this prompts a response from the original player who made the bet:</p> <h4>The Player Passes</h4> <p>The opponents score 4 arrialis, and don't have to show their cards.</p> <h4>The Player Accepts</h4> <p>The player and the raiser show their cards. The winner takes the entire pot (see above re: confusion on this point)[^confusion].</p> <p>[^confusion]: There are two rounds of Posta played in a row; therefore, during the second round, the value of the pot would be whatever was won in the first round. But during the first one, it would be empty under the above understanding. Therefore a raise would render the phase worthless. This suggests that there must be some type of ante, or that perhaps the &quot;pot&quot; is some fixed value associated with each round, but I can't see that in the description. It could also simply be fixed at 8 arrialis as a natural ceiling, given the figures above.</p> <pre><code>Comparison with similar games (see *Stoppa*, below) is also
unhelpful here, as the account of that game has a detailed account
of antes before playing which is entirely missing here.
</code></pre> <h3>Additional Calls</h3> <p>There are two additional calls that can be made by players with certain holdings: <em>Primiera</em> and <em>Frusciu</em>. My reading is that these don't interfere with the main bidding process (except where obvious; see below), and that payouts for these two calls take place apart from and sometimes in addition to the payout for the vying.</p> <p>According to my reading, both declarations are made when it is a player's turn, by turning either one or two (respectively) cards of their hand over on the table. Unlike with the vying, it doesn't appear that players can bluff about their holdings.</p> <h4>Primiera</h4> <p>The player turns one card over. This indicates that they hold a <em>primiera</em>, or four cards of different suits.</p> <p>Bet, no calls: 2 Bet, 1 sees: 4 Bet, 2 sees, opponents win: 4 Bet, 2 sees, bidder wins: 7 Bet, raise, pass: 4 Raise: whole pot (??)</p> </div> <div class=col-md-3> <h3>Recent Posts</h3> <table class=recent-posts> <tr> <td style=white-space:nowrap>2022-02-19</td> <td><a href=../posts/a-specification-of-a-note-taking-program.html>A Specification of a Note-Taking Program</a></td> </tr> <tr> <td style=white-space:nowrap>2021-03-20</td> <td><a href=../posts/algorithms-im-proud-of-fill.html>Algorithms I'm Proud Of: Fill</a></td> </tr> <tr> <td style=white-space:nowrap>2020-12-10</td> <td><a href=../posts/bagatto-a-new-static-site-generator.html>Bagatto, a New Static Site Generator</a></td> </tr> <tr> <td style=white-space:nowrap>2020-11-22</td> <td><a href=../posts/a-regular-simplification-of-offenbacher-schrift.html>A Regular Simplification of Offenbacher Schrift</a></td> </tr> <tr> <td style=white-space:nowrap>2020-08-20</td> <td><a href=../posts/mariglia.html>Mariglia</a></td> </tr> </table> </div> </div> </div> </div> <hr> <div class=footer>Built with <a href=https://bagatto.co>Bagatto.</a></div> </div> </div> </div> </body> </html>
