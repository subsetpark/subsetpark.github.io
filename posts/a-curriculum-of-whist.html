That either it's something worth knowing as a form of currency of adulthood, or it's simply the best choice for those of us who fancy ourselves to be polite, sophisticated adults.</p> <p>I share this sense. After all, the Times ran a Bridge column until 2015. So I understand where they're coming from, and it's only mentally that I respond with, 'no, you don't.'[^1]</p> <p>[^1]: I can't overstate the ambivalence with which I make this declaration. Even in writing this post I'm also imagining that I should probably read some old issues of the Times column. At the very least there may be material in there useful for players of other trick-taking games. And maybe the conventions aren't as bad as I feel they are. I know I've wondered that before, but still I wonder.</p> <p>The last thing I want is to defuse a nascent card player's enthusiasm. What I think---or hope---is underlying their interest is a sense that the world of card games is vast and conducive to socialization and, indeed, sophistication, subtlety and skill. And I make the assumption that they have simply not heard of many of the games that I think of as equal to Bridge in terms of sophistication (if not Anglophone reknown) and so are <em>really</em> interested in learning a sufficiently deep strategic card game, and not Bridge itself.</p> <p>Because the fact is, I can barely stand Bridge.</p> <p>Here are the things I like about Bridge: it's a deep game, highly reliant on skill, with relatively little bravura but quite a bit of reasoning, planning, and logical inference. Unfortunately, what I dislike about Bridge is nearly everything that is peculiar to Bridge as distinct from other members of the Whist family. I have absolutely no patience for what strikes <em>me</em> as the defining feature of Bridge, the massive accretion of <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridge_convention><strong>conventions</strong></a> that have grown up around the bidding phase in a Bridge hand, where a bid of a certain number of tricks in a certain suit is less a good-faith assertion that one could win a contract of that shape and more a message to one's partner about some specific feature of one's holdings, or a request for information even, to be answered by some other previously agreed-upon bid. And you know things have really gone off the rails when you consider the fanaticism around authorized and unauthorized information, where tournaments reliably will constrain players to exchanging convention cards or bidding behind screens in order to ensure that only a certain amount of predetermined and mutually understood coding is being exchanged.</p> <p>Anyway, what I hope and assume is that my interlocutors are not actually interested in Bridge per se and probably don't even know about bidding conventions. Because that gives us an opportunity to explore a wide family of games that share what is enjoyable about Bridge without bothering with the above.</p> <h1>Whist</h1> <p>I think it's not unfair to think of Bridge as an elaboration that almost entirely covers the simpler ancestral game of <a href=https://www.pagat.com/whist/whist.html>Whist</a>. Whist (and therefore Bridge) is a plain-trick game played by four (in teams of two) with a full 52-card deck without jokers, where all the cards are dealt out and the aim is to take the greater number of tricks when played at trumps. Any suit can be led to a trick; subsequent players must follow suit if they can, and otherwise may play any other card. The trick is taken by the highest trump played, or if no trump was played, by the highest card of the suit that was led.</p> <p>This core mechanism is surprisingly durable. A lot of what players like about Bridge is already there: all the cards are in play, and there are enough of them that it's not trivial (but also not too mysterious) to project exactly how any hand will play out. I'd actually recommend that anyone interested in Bridge start with simple Whist, especially if they can find a partner willing to learn with them.</p> <p>More to the point, I think it's very worthwhile to understand Whist because it is demystifying to think of a number of the more complex games we might be interested in as elaborations on Whist along one of a number of different dimensions. Here are the dimensions in question:</p> <ul> <li>How the trump suit is determined;</li> <li>How teams are formed (or whether one player should play against the rest);</li> <li>How many tricks are required to constitute a win;</li> <li>What the role of the defenders will be;</li> <li>How winning a game should relate to a larger playing session.</li> </ul> <h1>Whist with auction</h1> <p>Perhaps the most basic and most promising area for elaboration is <em>how the trump suit is determined</em>. After all, whether a suit is trumps or not will have an extraordinary amount to do with whether a hand is a winner or not; by the exact same token, the choice of trumps is an extremely valuable commodity which will go quite far in deciding who will win the hand. So it feels a bit of a waste to leave it entirely up to chance. We can enhance the richness of the game considerably by introducing a more interesting mechanism for determining trumps.</p> <p>It's also worth considering the reasoning behind introducing elaborations at all. Very often, it's in order to <em>reward greater skill</em>. It is a principle generally agreed upon that between two players who would like the opportunity to name trumps (or otherwise decide what kind of game to play), it's a good idea to give it to that player who is willing to undertake the more difficult, and presumably more lucrative, sort of game.</p> </div> <div class=col-md-3> <h3>Recent Posts</h3> <table class=recent-posts> <tr> <td style=white-space:nowrap>2022-02-19</td> <td><a href=../posts/a-specification-of-a-note-taking-program.html>A Specification of a Note-Taking Program</a></td> </tr> <tr> <td style=white-space:nowrap>2021-03-20</td> <td><a href=../posts/algorithms-im-proud-of-fill.html>Algorithms I'm Proud Of: Fill</a></td> </tr> <tr> <td style=white-space:nowrap>2020-12-10</td> <td><a href=../posts/bagatto-a-new-static-site-generator.html>Bagatto, a New Static Site Generator</a></td> </tr> <tr> <td style=white-space:nowrap>2020-11-22</td> <td><a href=../posts/a-regular-simplification-of-offenbacher-schrift.html>A Regular Simplification of Offenbacher Schrift</a></td> </tr> <tr> <td style=white-space:nowrap>2020-08-20</td> <td><a href=../posts/mariglia.html>Mariglia</a></td> </tr> </table> </div> </div> </div> </div> <hr> <div class=footer>Built with <a href=https://bagatto.co>Bagatto.</a></div> </div> </div> </div> </body> </html>
